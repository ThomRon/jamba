cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 3.9)

# In order to use the jamba framework you should include jamba.cmake directly or in other words do
#    include(<path_to_jamba>/jamba.cmake)
# instead of
#    add_subdirectory(<path_to_jamba>)
#
# The purpose of this file is so that it can be compiled separately to develop and test

include(jamba.cmake)
